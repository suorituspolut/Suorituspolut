## Feature: Definition of Done

- Feature has been tested: all the relevant unit- and integration tests have been done and/or the feature has been proven to be working through the user interface, if the tests are impossible to do. 
- Feature cannot be broken, when it is being pushed to the master-branch.
- New feature cannot break anything else in the master-branch.
- The added code has been commented so that the other team members can understand it and easily continue working based on it.
- The added code passes styling criteria set on Lint.
- The new feature passes the acceptance criteria set for it, thus works as it was supposed to.
- Each feature should be reviewed by peer, either through Github "request review" or on the spot, before it is pushed to the master-branch.


## Common coding practices: 

- Variables, classes etc. should use CamelCase and be in English
- New features are created initially into a feature-branch
- Commit-messages should be clear, short and in English
- Project architecture should follow the React-app conventions (found eg. in Fullstack Open -material)
